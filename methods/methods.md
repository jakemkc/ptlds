Figure 1. Case definitions of Lyme and PTLDS in current study. To define Lyme cases, we started from identifying the first Lyme disease record for each patient in the database (ICD = 088.81). Then, we selected the individuals who had consecutively enrolled in Aetna’s insurance plan for at least 1 year prior to and 2 years following the first records and use them as the baseline for all the subsequent analyses. For PTLDS, cases were defined progressively by adding new inclusion and exclusion criteria on top of Lyme disease patients. We filtered for Lyme patients who 1) did not complain for any one of the core PTLDS symptoms  -- chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, and pain -- 1 year prior to the baseline; 2) did not have another Lyme record from 1 month following the baseline, and 3) complained for any one of the core PTLDS symptoms within 6 months and after the 7th month from the baseline. Finally, we defined PTLDS patients as a subset of the core symptom patients not matching any one of the exclusion symptoms such as autoimmune disease, liver disease, and cancer that are proposed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Figure 2. Overview of the data extraction and analytical procedures used in this study. We started by extracting patients with the Lyme disease ICD-9 code “088.81”. Using their first Lyme disease records, we further filtered for those who minimally enrolled consecutively for 4 years -- one year prior to and two year following this record. After further filtering for PTLDS symptoms, we excluded 2 658 individuals and obtained 44 420 and 1 518 patients for Lyme disease and PTLDS respectively. To identify the patterns in and differences between Lyme and PTLDS, we conducted (A) demographic and (B) comorbidity analyses. Finally, we extracted 7 503 Lyme and 209 PTLDS patients with antibiotic prescription records that are 5 days within after their Lyme diagnosis and (C) analyzed the antibiotic usage.
