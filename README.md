## Abstract
### *BACKGROUND*
Post treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) is used to describe a condition where Lyme disease (LD) patients have received the recommended antibiotic treatment, but continue to experience persistent non-specific symptoms of fatigue, cognitive impairment, or musculoskeletal pain. The causes and diagnosis of PTLDS remain elusive, and some question the associations of prolonged symptoms with LD.

### *METHODS*
The insurance claims database covering over 63 million de-identified individuals (20% of the US population) with 9·8 billion claims records between 2008 and 2016. We used case-control (n = 40 594) design to test the associations of chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, and musculoskeletal pain with LD and employed a quasi-crossover design (n = 7 712) to explore the associations of 19 common chronic conditions with PTLDS over LD without prolonged symptoms.

### *RESULTS* 
We found that chronic fatigue (OR 1·67, 95% CI 1·42–1·96) and musculoskeletal pain (OR 1·31, 95% CI 1·12–1·53) were associated with LD. The associations remained robust after adjusted for four co-occurring chronic conditions and after accounting for a potentially 70% misdiagnosis rate of LD in claims data (n = 2 358). The PTLDS-to-Lyme patient ratio was 2·79%. SOnly nine of the conditions had enough sample size for further interpretation. Although six chronic conditions were associated with a 10% higher risk for PTLDS (ORs from 1·12 to 2·19); however, none of the conditions was statistically significant after controlling for multiple hypotheses (FDR = 0·05).


### *CONCLUSION* 
Chronic fatigue and musculoskeletal pain are sequelae consistently and robustly associated with LD patients. Observation of prolonged non-specific symptoms in LD patients after antibiotic therapy is not likely simply by chance
