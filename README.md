## Abstract
### *BACKGROUND*
Post treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) is used to describe Lyme disease patients who have the infection cured by antibiotic and with persisting symptoms of pain, fatigue, or difficulty thinking. It is an elusive condition with no accurate diagnosis, and hence little is known about the epidemiology, cause, and treatment of PTLDS. Here we use a large nationwide administrative dataset to identify unique aspects of PTLDS that could have diagnostic and etiologic values.

### *METHODS*
The Aetna insurance claims database consists of more than 9.8 billion billing and 1.4 billion prescription records between year 2008 to 2016. We defined PTLDS based on its symptomology and investigated the 1) demographic, 2) comorbidity, and 3) antibiotic usage patterns of Lyme and PTLDS.

### *RESULTS* 
The age and temporal distributions and their by sex patterns were similar between Lyme and PTLDS. We found that both Lyme and PTLDS were spreading to inland states when comparing the spatial maps of 2009 to 2013. The co-occurence of 3 out of 19 chronic conditions were significantly higher after Lyme diagnosis in PTLDS versus Lyme -- odds ratio and 95% CI for anemia, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthrosis were 1.46 (1.11-1.92), 1.39 (1.15-1.68), and 1.62 (1.23-2.12) respectively. For antibiotic prescription patterns, we found no significant differences between PTLDS and Lyme.

### *CONCLUSION* 
PTLDS patients have more complaints of anemia, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthrosis. Determining whether these comorbidities are simply confounding or sharing an underlying biological mechanism with PTLDS require further investigation.
