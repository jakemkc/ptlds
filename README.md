## Abstract
### *BACKGROUND*
Post treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) is used to describe a condition where Lyme disease patients have the infection cleared by antibiotic treatment but continue to experience persistent non-specific symptoms of fatigue, cognitive impairment, or musculoskeletal pain. The causes, diagnosis, and treatment of PTLDS remain elusive and some attribute the phenomenon to anchoring bias.

### *METHODS*
The insurance claims database contained more than 9.8 billion billing records between 2008 and 2016. We 1) used a case-control design to test the associations of chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, and musculoskeletal pain with Lyme disease (n = 244,463), and 2) employed a crossover design to investigate the association of 19 chronic conditions with PTLDS over Lyme disease (n = 45,938).

### *RESULTS* 
We found that chronic fatigue (OR 2.52, 95% CI 2.44–2.60) and musculoskeletal pain (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.47–1.56) were associated with Lyme disease. The associations remained robust after adjusting for co-occurring chronic conditions and with incrementally more precise definition of Lyme cases. The PTLDS-to-Lyme patient ratio was 3.42%. Compared with Lyme disease cases, we found an enrichment of anemia (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.11–1.92), hyperlipidemia (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.15–1.68), and osteoarthrosis (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.23–2.12) in PTLDS patients. 

### *CONCLUSION* 
Chronic fatigue and musculoskeletal pain were sequelae associated with Lyme disease patients, suggesting the existence of PTLDS. Identified comorbidities of PTLDS may be a potential complement to the existing guideline for better diagnosis of the syndrome.
